NOT READY FOR CONSUMPTION YET
This is my Scala port of Samekâ€™s excellent Quantum Hierarchical State
Machine as described in the book Practical Statecharts in C/C++ (Miro Samek, Ph.D.,
CMPBooks, 2002; http://www.quantum-leaps.com/). The port leverages my earlier port to C# (see http://www.hessmer.org/dev/qhsm/index.html). I am very new to Scala and are porting a framework that is based on imperative programming. Consequently in many areas the port has not made the transition to functional programming yet.
